# Algo-Trading-Strategy

Creating a full-fledged algorithmic trading strategy involves multiple steps and can be quite complex. However, I can provide you with a simplified example in Python to get you started. In this example, we'll create a simple moving average crossover strategy using historical stock price data. Please note that this is a basic example for educational purposes.

This code simulates a basic moving average crossover strategy and backtests it on historical stock price data. It calculates short-term and long-term moving averages, generates trading signals based on crossovers, and backtests the strategy by tracking the account balance.

Please note that this is a simplified example, and real-world algorithmic trading strategies involve many additional considerations, including risk management, transaction costs, and market conditions. Always exercise caution when implementing trading strategies, and consider seeking advice from financial professionals.
